# Open evolving system model
An ecosystem consists of various species.
The system has two features: the one is species living in the system interact with each other.
The other is new species invade the system constantly.
To examine how the diversity of the system changes depending on these features, we suggest an open evolving network model.
The dynamics of our model follows as the Lotka-Volterra type equation.
The equation is given by

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{d{x_i}}{dt} = G_i(\mathbf{x}) x_i \left( 1-\Sigma_j x_j/K \right) D_i(\mathbf{x}) x_i)

$ \frac{d{x_i}}{dt} = G_i(\mathbf{x}) x_i \left( 1-\Sigma_j x_j/K \right) D_i(\mathbf{x}) x_i $
Especially, the species living in the model share resources which are limited such as habitat and water resources, so-called Resource Limitation.



We suggeust a network model with a generalized Lotka-Volterra type equation in an Open Evolving System.
